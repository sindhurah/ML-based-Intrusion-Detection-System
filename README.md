# ML-based-Intrusion-Detection-System
ML project

1.	We require 2 laptops to run the project (Intruder and User)
2.	Connect 2 laptops to the same wi-fi Network
3.	Find  the IP address of the wi-fi network by running the code of ‘User’ using command “ipconfig”
4.	Enter the IP address in Intruder’s app.py and wait for the two laptops to connect
5.	First Run the main -app.py ,wait till it displays “listening ……”
6.	Then Run the USER -app.py 
7.	The link will be displayed on both the laptops -open it in any browser
8.	Register or Login 
9.	Enter any links in User(Intruder) and send 
10.	The link sent by user(Intruder) is received on Main’s laptop it detects and displays the response
11.	It contains two options either to continue or cancel
12.	If the link is safe – we can continue (Intruder will not receive data)
13.	If the link is not safe – if continue selected, (Intruder receives login details of the user) .
